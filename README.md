# fuzzy-eureka

This package allows users to programmatically open data from potentiostats (currently only those from PalmSens, but more options will be added later). In particular, it was designed to facilitate the manipulation of high-throughput or multiplexed measurements by organising data into multidimensional arrays which can be more easily addressed. 

Orignially part of the multiplexer-manager package, the fileopener.py file is being placed in a standalone package to make it easier for users to download and work with the file themselves. If you have any suggestions, let me know, otherwise I hope the code works well for you.
